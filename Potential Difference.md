[[Electricity]] > [[Potential Difference]]

Potential difference (also known as voltage) is the amount of transferrable energy that can be given to charge carriers in a [[Circuit]], normally electrons, and is measures in Volts (V).

In a Series [[Circuit]], potential difference is shared between [[Components]] based on [[Resistance]].
In a Parallel [[Circuit]], potential difference is equal between branches.
